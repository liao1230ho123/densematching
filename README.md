# densematching
compute the Stereo Correspondence between two given pictures, this work is done by C++ .  Will generate the following - dense map with compare to ground truth image 

We also compare the results by applying different method : SAD “sum of absolute differences” , SSD “Sum of Squared Differences” with respective to different window sizes. 

see the word report for more info!
